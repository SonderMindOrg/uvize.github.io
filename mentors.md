</a>

If you do, then you can choose to offer your availability globally or just at your school.

You can also input a mentor byline. This is searchable and will help students find you, so be sure to write about how you're willing to help.

Finally, you can input expertise tags. These tags help students find you as well.

Bookmarking a mentor allows you to 'save' a mentor that has been helpful to you or that you'd like to keep in contact with.

From a mentor's profile page, click the arrow to the right of the message block, and select "Bookmark Mentor" from the dropdown menu.

<a href="gfx/uvize-save-mentor.png">
  <img src="gfx/uvize-save-mentor.png" alt="save mentor" style="width:600px;">
</a>

Now the mentor will show up on the mentors page under "Your Mentors".

### <a name="engaging-mentors"></a>Engaging with a mentor

Mentorship is fundamental in the success of students. When engaging with a mentor, always be respectful of the mentor's time. Mentors volunteer themselves to help others out of their own time. Do not be rude or harass a mentor. If a mentor is unable to help you, then politely thank them for their time and reach out to another mentor who may be able to help you.
