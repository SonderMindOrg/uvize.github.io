### <a name="adding-attachments"></a>Adding an Attachment

You can add an attachment to any Post, Question or Answer by simply clicking on the "+" sign at the bottom of the comment box.  This will create a pop up window to allow you to select any file from your computer.

  <img src="gfx/uvize-attachment.png" alt="attachment" style="width:500px;">
</a>

Once the file has been chosen a preview window allows you to add a title and description to the attachment.
