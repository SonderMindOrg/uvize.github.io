Groups are a place to where students, mentors, and staff can meet and discuss common interests. Groups are commonly used for things such as common backgrounds (Army, MOS, etc), study groups (Bio 101 study group), majors (Mechanical Engineering majors), interests (Anime, TV shows), and more (Carpooling, etc).

* [Creating an event](events.html#creating-event)
* [Finding events](events.html#finding-events)
* [Viewing an event](events.html#viewing-event)
* [Managing an event](events.html#managing-event)

Events allow the members of groups to plan places and times to meet in person. Group administrators can create events for anything. Maybe it's a study session for a study group, or a casual social gathering for Army veterans on campus, or a planning meeting for the carpool schedule. All you need is a place and a time!
